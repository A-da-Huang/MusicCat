# 🎵 Musical Cat
Musical Cat is an interactive, keyboard-controlled soundboard built with p5.js that combines sound effects with simple image-based animation. Each key press triggers a sound while visually animating the cat, creating a playful and responsive experience that blends creativity with code.

This project was created as a fun way to explore event-driven programming, audio playback, and visual feedback in the browser using JavaScript. Also as my final project for my Creative Coding course.

p5.js makes creative coding accessible and beginner-friendly. It abstracts away complex browser APIs and allows developers to focus on interaction, visuals, and experimentation.

For this project, p5.js was ideal because it:

Simplifies keyboard input handling

Makes audio playback intuitive

Encourages rapid prototyping and creativity

# Overview
Musical Cat turns your keyboard into an instrument by pressing a key, and the cat reacts.

At its core, this project listens for keyboard input and maps specific keys to:

Sound effects (loaded from local audio files)

Animated cat images that change based on interaction.

The goal wasn’t just to play sounds, but to make the interaction feel alive by pairing audio with visual motion. By cutting and swapping image frames, the cat appears to move its arms when sounds are triggered.

This project demonstrates how simple animations and audio cues can significantly improve user experience, even in small projects.

# How it works
Built using p5.js and p5.sound

Keyboard input is captured using p5’s event handlers

Each key is mapped to:

A specific sound file

A corresponding image or animation frame

Sounds are preloaded to reduce latency

Images are swapped dynamically to simulate movement

The project runs entirely in the browser and requires no backend or build tools 

# Who made it
Hi! I’m Ada Huang, a Computer Science student first, and a cat lover second. I had lots of fun creating and drawing this program. I enjoy building projects that combine technical problem-solving with personality and humor.
Musical Cat was created as part of a programming final project to experiment with JavaScript libraries like p5.js and to better understand how user input, sound, and animation work together.
